# AI Ethics & COMPAS Analysis Repository

This repository contains both **Python scripts** and an **AI ethics document**. It is intended as a practical resource for exploring ethical AI principles, bias analysis, and fairness metrics in real-world datasets.

## 📂 Repository Contents

1. **Scripts**
   - `bias.py` – Python script analyzing the COMPAS two-year recidivism dataset.
     - Computes recidivism rates by race.
     - Calculates average risk scores.
     - Evaluates fairness metrics using AIF360 (statistical parity, disparate impact, equal opportunity, average odds, false positive rate).
   - Other scripts related to AI bias analysis and fairness evaluation.

2. **AI Ethics Document**
   - A comprehensive document covering:
     - Algorithmic bias: causes, examples, and mitigation strategies.
     - Transparency vs explainability in AI.
     - GDPR impacts on AI development, including consent, data minimization, and rights to explanation.
     - Ethical risks of biased facial recognition systems and high-stakes applications.
     - Case study: COMPAS recidivism analysis highlighting racial disparities.
     - Reflections on ethical AI design in personal projects, including recruitment tools.

## ⚖️ Purpose

This repository is designed for:

- Learning and understanding **ethical AI principles**.
- Practical application of fairness and bias evaluation in AI systems.
- Combining **theoretical guidance** (ethics document) with **practical tools** (Python scripts).

---

## 📋 How to Use

1. Review the AI ethics document to understand the principles, risks, and remediation strategies.
2. Run the Python scripts to explore real-world fairness analysis on datasets like COMPAS.
3. Use scripts and metrics to evaluate and improve AI system fairness in your own projects.
